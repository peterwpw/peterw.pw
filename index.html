    If you're looking here, you might be thinking to yourself: "Why such a minimal website?"
    The truth is, I believe less is more, when implemented effectively.
    So many websites have an over-reliance on bloated css and especially javascript frameworks.
    Minimalistic html and css can accomplish in kilobytes what modern javascript frameworks can only accomplish in sometimes dozens of megabytes.
    Personally, I find that annoying.
    Designing for minimalism and efficiency allows people with less powerful hardware and internet connections to access your service in less time with less hassle.
    It also increases user accessibility by minimizing distractions and improving the ease-of-use of screen readers and other assisted web access technology.
    Moreover, designing websites, programs, etc. with data size in mind increases efficiency of the entire grid, allowing more data to flow with less energy cost.
